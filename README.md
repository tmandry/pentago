pentago
=======

A simple implementation and AI for the game Pentago in Go. I implemented this for an AI class assignment.

To run: Clone and cd into this repository, and type
```sh
go run main.go
```
To see the AI play itself. To play the AI, you can, for example:
```sh
go run main.go human ai
```
You can provide zero, one, or two parameters, and acceptable values are **human**, **random**, and **ai**.
